        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>These shredded Wood Ear mushrooms look like destroyed confidential files from a government office rather than food. Perhaps under all that black you might find some undisclosed secret kept hidden from the public.But no, these are mushrooms. Hydrated, these delicate strings of finely sliced Wood Ear mushroom become brown and crunchy with a forest-y flavor.Many chefs have begun to treat shredded Wood Ear like a pasta as instead of a mushroom. Add them to cold soba dishes, or tangle together with fettuccini and slather in an alfredo sauce for an East-meets-West dish. We like to add them into a chicken soup for their antiviral properties. Curious in texture, intriguing in flavor, and with a contemporary appearance this mushroom is perfect for the hip home cook.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>An accidental discovery, the first Worcestershire sauce was made in Worcester England, by John Wheeley Lea and William Perrins, a couple of pharmacists with a eye for culinary intrigue. Originally, the sauce was sold as both a flavoring and a digestive agent.The sauce in question was actually a British attempt to recreate a fermented fish sauce called garum, a popular flavoring used in Italy and Greece. The anchovy-based recipe was flavored with tamarind, cloves, malt vinegar, onion, molasses, and other ingredients. However, the resulting sauce was so completely inedible that the remaining barrels were shelved aside. After time, however, the sauce had mellowed and fermented taking on a lovely flavor.And that is Worcestershire sauce.This sauce is just that, but itâ€™s been dehydrated and into a significantly more potent Worcestershire seasoning. Worcestershire powder can be mixed with water to form a quick sauce, but we also love it in rubs for ribs or sprinkled onto a steak or ham during the last bits of cooking so it can form a Worcestershire glaze.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>

        <SPICE_DESCRIPTION>Zaatar spice is the name of both a popular seasoning and herbal shrub found in the Middle East. Obviously, we're here to talk about the seasoning. Za atar is a zesty, sour, nutty spice blend that owes much of its flavor to sumac and to toasted sesame seeds. Salt is often added, but from there on it really depends on who is making it. Some commercial varieties also include roasted flour. Our blend comes with oregano and thyme to create an overly herbal salty-sour mix with plenty of earthiness from the sesame.Zaatar spice mix is often enjoyed as a condiment. Dip bread in your favorite olive oil, and then dip into a bowl of Zaatar for an easy appetizer with zing. Whip into butter, ricotta, or sour cream for tangy spread and dips. If you plan to make your own French fries or potato chips, sprinkle them with Zaatar once they finish cooking for a fragrant snack.</SPICE_DESCRIPTION>
